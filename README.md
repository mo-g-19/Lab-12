# Path for Completing Lab 12 in k21 Academy

## Objective
- Load datasets
- preprocess data
- select and train a classification algorithm
- evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

End of the lab: create and asses a basic ML classification model in Python

## Steps
1) Go through the getting started guide, and learn the basic outline of Scikit Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html)

2) #### Load datasets:
    - Tutorials Point: How can scikit-learn library be used to load data in Python (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-can-scikit-learn-library-be-used-to-load-data-in-python)
    - Feature Selection in Python with Scikit-Learn (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/feature-selection-in-python-with-scikit-learn/)
    - Future reference -> User Guide: 8. Dataset loading utilities (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html)

3) #### Preprocess data
    -
    - Future reference -> User Guide: 7.3 Preprocessing data (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html)

4) #### Select and train a classification model
    - 
    - Geeks for Geeks: Select and train a classification algorithm (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/comprehensive-guide-to-classification-models-in-scikit-learn/)

5) #### Multiple references for evaluate model performance....
    - Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr7lbdgzpWM
    - Geeks for Geeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/sklearn-classification-metrics/
    - Future reference -> User Guide: 3.4 https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html

Each section will have it's own directory to help with organizing files
